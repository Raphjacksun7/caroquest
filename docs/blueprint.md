# **App Name**: Diagonal Domination

## Core Features:

- Chessboard UI: Implement an 8x8 chessboard using common chess design pattern as baseline.
- Checker Pawns: Implement pawn pieces of different colors to represent different players, but that can act the same (can't move if it's horizontally blocked).
- Show Valid Moves: Indicate the squares available for the selected user during the selection and movement phases.
- Indicate Blocked Pieces: Visually identify blocked pieces and the pieces that perform a blocking (including the ones that make a diagonal dead-zone).
- Victory UI: Highlight the line of 4 pawns in diagonal when one player wins

## Style Guidelines:

- Classic chessboard colors: Light squares in beige (#F0D9B5), dark squares in brown (#B58863).
- Player 1 pieces: Warm red (#E63946) for high visibility and contrast.
- Player 2 pieces: Cool blue (#457B9D) for easy differentiation.
- Accent color: Use a teal (#A8DADC) to indicate current player's turn.
- Clean, minimalist layout with the chessboard as the focal point.
- Clear, legible font for player names and game status.
- Use simple icons for settings and help options.
- Subtle animations when pieces are moved and for highlighting the winning diagonal.
